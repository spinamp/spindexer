### Motivation

When a request for new platform integration into the Spindexer is made we need to technically evaluate the request upfront.

A developer should complete the checklist in this template to evaluate the integration.

### Checklist for evaluation of integration request

- [ ]  Platform/Artist Name:
- [ ]  Chain:
- [ ]  Would this integration require building new general feature(s) in the Spindexer?
- [ ]  Would this integration require new specialized feature(s) in the Spindexer?
- [ ]  Which mapper / extractors are appropriate for both tracks and artists?
